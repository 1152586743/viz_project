The dataset offers a starting point for understanding previous climate grounds and trends. The second dataset used by our project is the ‘nearterm_data_2020-2024.csv’ dataset, which hosts near-term climate forecasts obtained from multiple Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios. By integrating these two datasets, one can develop a comprehensive picture of climate trends and their potential implications for park ecosystems.

These datasets were combined into a single DataFrame, removing all rows with missing values ​​and ensuring that there were no duplicate fields. This first step removed duplicates and completely empty records by merging relevant data.\nNext we determined which columns are appropriate for each aggregation technique. For the columns representing vegetation (Canopy, Ann_Herb, Bare, Herb, Litter, Arbusb), we determined the highest values ​​for each group. We used a custom function to correctly remove nulls and NaNs from averages of other columns. The DataFrame was then grouped using the appropriate aggregation functions for long, lat, year, TimePeriod, RCP and scenario.\nFinally, we cleaned the dataset by removing the DrySoilDays_Summer_whole, PPT_Annual, and T_Annual columns that had large missing values ​​or were not needed for further analysis. Possible missing values ​​ExtremeShortTermDryStress_Summer_whole and NonDrySWA_Summer_whole were filled with the mean of the corresponding column.

The linear trend shows that the RCP 8.5 sequence seems to be an ever more short-term increases in temperature, without power measures to reduce emissions. From our analysis, the parks are likely to suffer from the hot summer and winters which would significantly impact ecosystems. The linear increase in average temperature over time is further supported by the interactive line graphs for summer and winter temperature, more particularly on the RCP 8.5 sequence. These will have a drastic impact on the volume of precipitation required for the ecological balance of the national parks located in southeastern Utah."

Since the changes in precipitation have the ability to change the overall distress of the ecosystem, the vegetation growth, and the availability of water, it is important to investigate these changes. Our analysis on changes in temperature and precipitation holds a full view of potential impacts across our assigned areas of conservation: historic and future-projected summer and winter precipitation now shed light on just what those impacts could be."

Soil moisture is one of the key factors in the sustainability of ecosystems, plant health, and water availability. A comparison of VWC in the different seasons—winter, spring, summer, and fall—can infer how these changes may affect the health of plants and park soils. Evidently, from the interactive line graphs, it shows that the soil moistures have seriously changed over the past decades. However, the future values for the RCP 8.5 sequence are showing the trend of an increase, which is significant for summer. It is an indication that many national parks may have suffered severe droughts where plants have died off and species composition in the park is further altered. This overview of the four seasons and potential impacts throws light on the policy needs for the future to mitigate the impacts of climate change on soil moisture."

These movements might severely affect park ecosystems, degrading biodiversity, water resources, and impossible plant survival. By comparing the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 future expected occurrence with existing historical data, people may project future events. Frosting days have varied over time, as shown by the bar graphs, but are expected to continue under the RCP 8.5 series. Conversely, more intense temporary drought stress is predicted during the summer, resulting in warmer and dehydrated climate. Hence, parks are expected to endure more severe, recurring droughts, which may kill off plants and change ecosystem composition. Understanding these trends is essential for creating strategies that could increase conservation areas’ natural value."

The interactive map landscapes various park locations, informing the user about the location’s extremes and soil moistures. Another drop-down selection enables the user to identify a function that tracks spatial trends, assisting them in selecting park extremes and vulnerable locations that require special care and attention. The picture is critical for future analysis and planning because it indicates areas deserving more focus as a result of rapid going weather."

    "text": "Conclusion\nBorrowing this comprehensive knowledge from potential organizational impacts, in conclusion, the Southeastern Utah Group of National Parks is a vital trend published. Temperature, precipitation, soil moistures, and extenuating occurrences are all significant factors to consider. By studying historic trends and future predictions under various RCP scenarios, one better understands relevant trends and variations. Our analysis indicates a semi-lineal increase in temperature will lead to warmer summers and mild winters. Such changes will be followed shortly after by precipitation, drastically lowering soil moisture throughout the summer. The drought stress indicated will be enough to modify plant composition and vegetation formation. Separately, an increase in extenuating phenomena including short-term drought pulls and reduced frostings proposes that environmental components pattern and respond to increased deviations. Various foundation changes are required in the form of alterable administration modules."
