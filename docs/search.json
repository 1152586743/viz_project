The first dataset, “NABR_historic.csv,” contains historical climate data, providing a baseline for understanding past climate conditions and trends. The second dataset, “nearterm_data_2020-2024.csv,” includes near-term climate projections, offering insights into expected future changes based on different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. By combining these datasets, we can compare historical data with projected future conditions, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of climate trends and their potential effects on the park ecosystems.

    "text": "Data filtering process\nTo begin data cleaning, we downloaded two datasets: nearterm_data_2020-2024.csv, which contained near-term climate projections, and NABR_historic.csv, which contained historical climate data. These datasets were combined into a single DataFrame, removing all rows with missing values ​​and ensuring that there were no duplicate fields. This first step removed duplicates and completely empty records by merging relevant data.\nNext we determined which columns are appropriate for each aggregation technique. For the columns representing vegetation (Canopy, Ann_Herb, Bare, Herb, Litter, Arbusb), we determined the highest values ​​for each group. We used a custom function to correctly remove nulls and NaNs from averages of other columns. The DataFrame was then grouped using the appropriate aggregation functions for long, lat, year, TimePeriod, RCP and scenario.\nFinally, we cleaned the dataset by removing the DrySoilDays_Summer_whole, PPT_Annual, and T_Annual columns that had large missing values ​​or were not needed for further analysis. Possible missing values ​​ExtremeShortTermDryStress_Summer_whole and NonDrySWA_Summer_whole were filled with the mean of the corresponding column.

The graphs show a steady increase in average temperatures over time, and this has clearly accelerated in recent years. The RCP 8.5 scenario shows a clearer trend, suggesting faster temperature increases if emissions continue. According to this study, the parks are likely to experience warmer summers and winters, which could significantly affect ecosystems."

The bar graphs show projected changes in precipitation over time and highlight differences between historical data and projected estimates for the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. These changes are important to understand because fluctuations in precipitation can affect overall ecosystem health, vegetation growth, and water availability. We can get a comprehensive overview of the potential effects of climate change on these protected areas by looking at changes in temperature and precipitation."

Soil moisture affects the sustainability of the entire ecosystem, plant growth and water availability. We can learn more about how these variations can affect plant and soil stability in the park by looking at volumetric water content (VWC) in winter, spring, summer and fall, along with historical and projected values.\nInteractive line charts show that soil moistures in each season have been significant in recent decades. Future estimates under the RCP 8.5 scenario show a decrease in soil moisture, especially in summer. This pattern indicates that more severe drought could occur in the parks, stressing plants and possibly changing species composition. An extensive seasonal study highlights the importance of understanding and reducing the impact of climate change on soil moisture to protect the park’s natural values."

These events can have negative effects on park ecosystems, affecting biodiversity, water availability and plant survival. We estimate the potential increase in these extreme events by comparing the projected future events of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 with historical data.\nThe number of freezing days in winter has changed over time, as shown in the bar graphs, but is projected to decrease under the RCP 8.5 scenario. On the other hand, more extreme short-term drought stress is predicted in the summer, leading to warmer and drier weather. These results indicate that parks are likely to experience more frequent and severe droughts, which can increase plant mortality and change ecosystem structure. Understanding these patterns is important for developing tactics to strengthen park ecosystems against the harms of global warming."

A drop-down menu allows users to select a function to track spatial variations and find the most affected locations.

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis project provides a comprehensive analysis of the potential impacts of climate change on the Southeastern Utah Group of National Parks, focusing on key factors such as temperature, precipitation, soil moisture and extreme weather events. Using historical data and future climate projections under different RCP scenarios, we identified important trends and changes that may affect the ecosystems of these parks.\nThe findings suggest a clear increase in temperature, especially under the RCP 8.5 scenario, which could lead to warmer summers and milder winters. This increase in temperature is likely to be accompanied by changes in precipitation, which can lead to a decrease in soil moisture, especially during the summer months. Such conditions can exacerbate drought stress, affect plant growth and change the composition of park vegetation. In addition, the projected increase in extreme weather events (eg, short-term drought stresses and reduced frost days) underscores the need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate their effects.\nIn general, this project emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and preventive measures to preserve the ecological integrity of the National Parks of Southeastern Utah. By understanding and addressing the potential impacts of climate change, park managers and conservationists can better protect these vital ecosystems for future generations. The interactive visualizations and analyzes presented in this study are valuable tools for informed decision-making and long-term planning in a changing climate."
